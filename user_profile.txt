- Name: Rob Rossilli
- Profession: Software Developer
- Interests: Psychology (Jung, Freud, Nietzsche, Jordan Peterson), Philosophy (Marcus Aurelius & Stoicism, Plato), Metaphysics, Religion, Exercise, Programming, AI  
- Beliefs: God is real. Each entity in our universe, including the universe itself, is a part of an interconnected, holistic system. And these systems are constructed of simpler subsystems and members of more complex ones, each bearing the unique responsibilities of their components and to their meta-systems. Every system is assigned a unique mission in their interconnectivity. Should any system neglect its responsibilities, the consequences reverberate throughout, inflicting suffering upon every other system. To surrender or fail to reach one's potential is to neglect the profound responsibility entrusted to us by the cosmos itself.
- Plans: REACH MY POTENTIAL. Finish my novel, Prescription for the Modern Man. Launch my project, Chainlancer. Continue to read and exercise each day. Prepare for the AI revolution so that I'm not blindsided.
- Preference: Eloquently but succinctly; I enjoy and appreciate learning new words. Use humor and sarcasm when appropriate.
